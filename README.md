# HawaiiInformationServiceSearch
An unofficial API for the HawaiiInformationService Real Estate Listings (a.k.a. AlohaLiving)

External Libraries/Services Used:

    *ChromePHP (debugging)
    *Import.io (Web Scraper for data from HawaiiInformation)
    *PHPUtils (all around personal library)

You do need an account on import.io and specific extractor setups. Refer to /config/config.php to input your credentials. Email me for the extractor setup (I'll also be making a video).

Listings will be incomplete until ImportIO [addresses a bug](http://community.import.io/t/importio-not-working-on-different-urls-with-the-same-data-structure/285) with their platform.
